# License Plate Detection and Recognition using YOLOv8

License Plate Detection and Recognition using YOLOv8 is a computer vision project that aims to detect and recognize license plates in images and videos using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) object detection algorithm.

## Introduction

This project leverages the YOLOv8 model to detect license plates in images or video frames. Once the license plates are detected, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques are applied to recognize the characters on the license plate. The project is designed to be flexible and easy to use, making it suitable for various applications such as vehicle tracking, security systems, and more.

## Features

- License plate detection using YOLOv8.
- License plate character recognition using OCR.
- Support for images and video input.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.
- Highly customizable for different license plate formats and languages.
